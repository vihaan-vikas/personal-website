      <h2>The Mars Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Mars Project is a python-based simulation that models a rocket's journey from Earth to Mars using real orbital mechanics. This project combines scientific accuracy with clear data visualization to simulate and display the trajectory of an interplanetary mission in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powered by my interest in spaceflight and physics, I set out to create a simulation that would not only visualize a rocket’s path through the solar system but also reflect the actual mathematical models used in orbital transfers. I wanted this project to be both educational and technically rigorous—bridging the gap between space science and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Python as the primary language, I incorporated equations governing two-body orbital dynamics and gravitational forces to calculate the spacecraft's trajectory between Earth and Mars. The simulation accounted for planetary motion, transfer windows, and realistic velocity vectors to ensure that the rocket's motion followed physically accurate paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the simulation visually interpretable, I used Matplotlib to create a 3D animated plot that shows the rocket’s changing position in relation to Earth and Mars over time. The visualization updates live, giving a clear picture of how the spacecraft exits Earth’s orbit, travels along a transfer trajectory, and approaches Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key challenges was modeling orbital transfers in a way that balanced both physical accuracy and computational simplicity. I had to ensure the orbital paths were realistic without making the simulation too complex to run smoothly. Fine-tuning initial velocity vectors and syncing planetary positions were also critical to ensuring a successful Mars intercept.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mars Project was a deep dive into orbital mechanics, applied math, and scientific visualization. It pushed me to think like both a physicist and a programmer, and it strengthened my skills in mathematical modeling, simulation development, and data presentation. The final result is a concise yet powerful demonstration of how software can bring space science to life.
